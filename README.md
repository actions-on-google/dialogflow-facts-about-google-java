# Actions on Google: Facts about Google Sample using Java

This is a knowledgeable Action that shares interesting facts about Google. The sample introduces advanced features like custom entities, contexts, and deep links. Use this Action and you might see that it even knows about a subject other than Google!

## Setup Instructions

### Action configuration
1. Use the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com) to add a new project with a name of your choosing and click *Create Project*.
1. Click *Skip*, located on the top right.
1. On the left navigation menu under *BUILD*, click on *Actions*. Click on *Add Your First Action* and choose your app's language(s).
1. Select *Custom intent*, click *BUILD*. This will open a Dialogflow console. Click *CREATE*.
1. Click on the gear icon to see the project settings.
1. Select *Export and Import*.
1. Select *Restore from zip*. Follow the directions to restore from the `dialogflow-agent.zip` file in this repo.
1. Deploy the fulfillment webhook as described in the next section
1. Go back to the Dialogflow console and select *Fulfillment* from the left navigation menu. Enable *Webhook*, set the value of *URL* to the webhook from the next section, then click *Save*.

### Webhook

When a new project is created using the Actions Console, it also creates a Google Cloud project in the background.
Copy the name of this project from the Action Console project settings page.

#### Build for Google Cloud Platform
    1. Instructions for [Google Cloud App Engine Standard Environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/)
    1. Use gcloud CLI to set the project to the name of your Actions project. Use 'gcloud init' to initialize and set your Google cloud project to the name of the Actions project.
    1. Deploy to [App Engine using Gradle](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/using-gradle) by running the following command: `gradle appengineDeploy`. You can do this directly from
    IntelliJ by opening the Gradle tray and running the appEngineDeploy task. This will start the process to deploy the fulfillment code to Google Cloud App Engine.

## Test on the Actions on Google simulator
1. Select [*Integrations*](https://console.dialogflow.com/api-client/#/agent//integrations) from the left navigation menu and open the *Settings* menu for Actions on Google.
1. Enable *Auto-preview changes* and Click *Test*. This will open the Actions on Google simulator.
1. Type `Talk to my test app` in the simulator, or say `OK Google, talk to my test app` to any Actions on Google enabled device signed into your developer account.
